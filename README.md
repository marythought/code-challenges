## Repo for various code challenges and solutions.

### TODOS:
* organize code by type of challenge (trees, arrays, string manipulation, etc)
* add formal tests for all working code
  - sq_root
  - equi_index
  - tribonacci
  - twisted sum
* add problem descriptions to code so I know what I was solving and source if applicable
