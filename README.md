## Repo for various code challenges and solutions.

### How to Use
* set up a new challenge ```rake new[NAME]```
* run tests: ```rake test```
* run one test: ```rake test TEST=test/[NAME]_test.rb TESTOPTS="--name=test_foobar1 -v"```

### TODOS:
* organize code by type of challenge (trees, arrays, string manipulation, etc)
* add formal tests for all working code
  - sq_root
  - equi_index
  - tribonacci
* add problem descriptions to code so I know what I was solving and source if applicable
